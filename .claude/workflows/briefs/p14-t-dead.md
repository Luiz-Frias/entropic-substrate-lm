# p14-t-dead: Dead-code sweep: family adapter, EncoderShape, targets facade, d1_configs_dir, ACL lease (RETIRE)

Authoritative brief for one `td-phase-lifecycle.cascade` lane, written 2026-09-28 by the p14 planning lane from the ratified-pending manifest. Plan: `docs/plans/p14-consolidation.plan.md#p14-t-dead`. Linear: FOR-1574, FOR-1590, FOR-1594, FOR-1600, FOR-1605. The lane's `acceptance` arg reads "Per the brief's ACCEPTANCE section"; this file is where that section lives. Premises were measured at `eb93d5d`, whose `src` equals the epoch `651af30`; the prelaunch ceremony re-probes them at the re-stamped `verified_at`.

## Contract surface owned

None. This phase changes no door and freezes no new contract.

## Contracts consumed

R-rails: every item is LANDED before this lane launches.

- nothing beyond the trunk at the phase parent

## Sacred invariants

Verbatim source, then the tripwire that detects a breach at fire time, then the guard-teeth recipe.

## Identity members

None: this phase's touch set has an empty intersection with the 51 reader-tuple files, measured by `comm` against `ladder/run/checkpoint.py:65-116` and `ladder/capture/capture.py:29-37`. Editing any of them is a HALT.

## Scope

Pure deletions, every consumer enumerated by grep at the epoch.

- FOR-1574: delete `ladder/gate/d1_family_adapter.py`; zero importers.
- FOR-1590: delete `EncoderShape` from `kernel/identity/d1_primitives.py:196`, its import and `__all__` row in `ladder/register/d1.py:17,74`, and its construction case in `tests/test_d1_stabilization.py:9,18`.
- FOR-1594: delete the facade `core/latent/targets.py`; repoint its five test importers to the three real modules.
- FOR-1600: delete `d1_configs_dir` from `ladder/register/d1_config.py:25,35`; call `kernel.runtime.config.configs_dir` at `:77,80`; repoint the eight test importers: `test_d1_config_parser_hardening.py`, `test_d_ladder_remote.py:19`, `test_d_ladder_probe_cli.py`, `test_ladder_profile.py`, `test_d1_config_catalog.py`, `d1_trainer_fixtures.py`, `test_d_ladder_review_contracts.py`, `test_d1_gpu_tiny_profiles.py`.
- FOR-1605: RETIRE (ruling 10): delete `ladder/analyze/d1_output_access.py` and `tests/test_d1_output_access.py`; zero production importers ever.

## ACCEPTANCE

Machine-checkable, one line each.

- An absence test asserts `family_identity_from_experiment`, `EncoderShape`, `core.latent.targets`, `d1_configs_dir` and `D1SetfaclOutputAccess` are not importable.
- `git grep -nE 'EncoderShape|d1_family_adapter|d1_configs_dir|d1_output_access|core\.latent\.targets' src tests` is empty.
- remap_check over the re-derived mapping reports the deleted modules gone and inversions and cycles at or under 1 and 4.
- `tools/mapping.json` is untouched; the subset rule at `tests/test_identity_epoch.py:634-663` passes with the deleted nodes.
- remap_check at the tip over a mapping re-derived by the p13 procedure, never the committed `p13-sweep-mapping.json`: inversions <= 1, package cycles <= 4. Output in the PR body.
- Mechanical counts at the tip at or under the epoch values below, output in the PR body.
- Admissibility evidence in the PR body for every abstraction introduced: consolidated sites as `path:line`, and the AST branch count at each call site holding flat or falling (ruling 14).
- `git diff --name-only mythwave/p14-t-core...HEAD` is a subset of *Allowed files*; the identity tripwire above is empty.
- `just check` green; exit gate `just pc-ci` via `uv run python scripts/run_exit_gate.py`; `lint-imports` clean.

```

## Non-goals

Thoroughness beyond ACCEPTANCE is NOT welcome. Anything that looks necessary for correctness is a `DECISION`, not an edit.

- Does NOT promote `_family_identity` in `d1_registration_codec.py`; no caller needs it.
- Does NOT touch anything in `tests/test_d_ladder_remote.py` beyond the `:19` import; `p14-t-historical` owns that file.
- Does NOT move `d1_output_access.py`; it is deleted, not relocated.
- Does NOT rename or touch `require_sha256_hex_any_case` in `d1_primitives.py`.
- Does NOT launch pods, spend GPU or start any h-ladder flywheel run (ruling 8).

## Allowed files

The escalation door: if correctness would require touching a file outside this envelope, a contract surface, or a sacred invariant, DO NOT EDIT. Return `DECISION` with the verification you ran. Every path was verified to exist at `eb93d5d` unless marked new.

- `ladder/capture/capture.py`, `ladder/run/journal.py`, and `object_fields` in `kernel/artifacts.py` as JSON sites (ruling 5)

| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| re-add `EncoderShape` to `d1_primitives.py` | the absence test                    |
| restore `d1_configs_dir` as an alias        | the absence test and the empty grep |

## Planned commit branches

1. FOR-1574 delete the dead family adapter
2. FOR-1590 delete EncoderShape
3. FOR-1594 delete the targets facade
4. FOR-1600 delete d1_configs_dir
5. FOR-1605 retire the ACL output lease
